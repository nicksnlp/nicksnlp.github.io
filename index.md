## Introduction

Hi there! This is my webpage. I study at Helsinki University, MA in Language Technology. I speak English, Swedish, Russian and a bit of French. The next on the list are Latvian, Finnish and Dutch, but for now I will probably concentrate more on Python and Haskell.

You can find my CV [here](assets/documents/Nikolay_Vorontsov____CV.pdf).
