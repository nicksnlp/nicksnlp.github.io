## About the course
A nice introduction to the command line and basic programming environment.  
As this was my first course, it was also a good intro to learning at Helsinkin University in general, the self-assisted learning style and the assignements/grading system.

## Week 1
Basic intro.  
Well, the first week teaches you to walk, to navigate your system, usign command line and the pipeline e.g.:

## Week 2
I would call it Intro 2, similar to week 1, but slightly deeper, work with remote server introduced.

## Week 3
Getting hands on texts. I have made some long pipelines here :).

## Week 4
Processing texts, regular expressions.

## Week 5
Scripts make live simplier and bring joy!

## Week 6
Program installations, nothing more to say.. But _make_ command is great!

## Week 7
Version Control, I think I liked it.

## Week 8 (Time goes fast...)
GitHub, Jekyll and Final Project. Thas is all you see here.
